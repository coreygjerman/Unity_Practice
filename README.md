# Unity_Practice

The files here are practice projects I've been working on using the Unity API.
The site I'm using for familiarizing myself with the Unity Engine is catlikecoding.com.

Currently, the builds that are posted in this repository are for Windows 64-bit systems.
I'm working on getting WebGL builds up, but my current WebGL builds are not working as intended - stay tuned.

Source code for each project has been included in their respective folder as well.
